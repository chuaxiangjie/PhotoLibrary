## Design

Hereâ€™s a rephrased version:

### Image Uploader Tool
**Functionality**: Enables users to upload images, which are then sent to the Photo Library API. The uploaded images are stored in a designated folder.

### PhotoLibrary Web
**Functionality**: Receives images uploaded via the API, stores them in a local folder, and provides a webpage for browsing all uploaded images.
